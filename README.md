# commvault_chatbot
MVP for a commvault chatbot which uses NLP to helps users find articles. 

First, install all necessary libraries. You need numpy, pandas, pytorch (torch), NLTK, flask, transformers, scikit-learn, and python's XML library. 

After installing all libraries, run nltk_utils.py and uncomment the "nltk.download()" program to download the necessary nltk packages. You don't need to run it after the first time, so you can re-comment or delete it. 

We have included a data.pth file, but if you ever change that file, run train.py to make a new one. 

To run the app, run app.py.
